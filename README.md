This code is a public copy of our svn repository, it is not maintained and will be updated intermittedly.

**This code should not be considered an open source project. It is for reference only.**

We wanted to share the work we had done implementing a mobile web app for the University of Kent but didn't have time to package it up into a deployable maintained library. So instead we've put it on github as is, in case there is anyone out there who is curious as to what we've done and will get value from it. 

You are welcome to take what ever code or inspiration you find useful but &lt;voiceofdoom&gt;DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK&lt;/voiceofdoom&gt;.
